<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Hi Tri-Fun members!&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am excited to let you know that we have completely revamped the Tri-Fun website and made it much easier to use. AND we&rsquo;ve added 3 new venues to your Experience Pass, making it now worth over $300!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>NEW VENUES</u></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Reach Museum</strong>&nbsp;| Learn all out the living land, Ice Age Floods, the Cold War era, Manhattan Project and the Hanford Site, or all about Richland.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.visitthereach.org/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.visitthereach.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544549260236000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE26Wynr8z6DhzStGZuPYsou4Dwiw">https://www.<wbr />visitthereach.org/</a></li>
<li><strong>East Benton County History Museum</strong>&nbsp;| Through the end of the year, you can see their permanent exhibits AND a traveling hands-on exhibit: Trivial Pursuit, a 50-State Adventure! Plan your trip now, and check out their website,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ebchs.org/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ebchs.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544549260236000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEu02Rsl_9Q4U89QXOIc8HVGGRHrg">http://www.ebchs.org/</a>.</li>
<li><strong>The Glass Punty</strong>&nbsp;| Have you ever tried glass fusing? It&rsquo;s fun and it&rsquo;s local! You can make a 6&rdquo; plate or bowl. Amaze yourself and your friends!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><u>ACADEMY OF CHILDREN&rsquo;S THEATRE</u></div>
<div>And, your benefit at Academy of Children&rsquo;s Theatre changed. Instead of a ticket to a main stage production, you can sign your child or grandchild up for a class! Classes are offered throughout the year for pre-k through high school. Your benefit is valid up to $100. Check it out here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.academyofchildrenstheatre.org/classes/classes/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.academyofchildrenstheatre.org/classes/classes/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544549260236000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFg6JyMrtmsl1njTq_B0-gC4Za_vw">http://www.<wbr />academyofchildrenstheatre.org/<wbr />classes/classes/</a></div>

<div><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Using your Pass</strong></span></div>
<div>Using your pass has changed&mdash;but it&rsquo;s much easier and it&rsquo;s completely mobile-friendly. Just log into your account on your mobile phone. Once you have, you&rsquo;ll see your existing Experience Pass with all of your available benefits. Choose the one you want, and hit REDEEM. In most cases, you&rsquo;ll do this AT the venue, but in some cases, like a class at Academy of Children&rsquo;s Theatre or Wet Palette, you register in advance. The venue will give you a code to input. Once you input the code and hit REDEEM NOW, the benefit is removed from your pass.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></strong></div>
<div><strong><span style="font-size: large;">And there is MORE!&nbsp;</span></strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We have launched a brand new Dining Pass! For $50, you get 10 buy-one-get-one-FREE entrees at some of the *best* locally owned non-franchise restaurants in town. Use your 10 meals at any of the member restaurant venues including Foodies, Frost Me Sweet, Kimo&rsquo;s, R.F. McDougall&rsquo;s, Europa, Village Bistro, The Bluff Stop, Emerald of Siam, Tumbleweeds, Foodies Too (opening on the Parkway in Richland later this month), and 4th Base Pizza &amp; Wingz.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All you need to do now is log in to your account. Use your email address to start the log in process and then reset your password.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We hope when you see what we&rsquo;ve done and where we are going with Tri-Fun that you&rsquo;ll be as excited as we are. Spend some time making memories this holiday season and use your Tri-Fun Pass!<br /><br />
